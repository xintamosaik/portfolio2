        It all started with Basic. When I was a kid, my parents got me a
        Commodore 64. I fell into a trance back then and never got out. The
        games, tools, programs, learning Basic and screwing up direct memory
        access, all of it fascinated me and set me on a journey of curiosity and
        discovery in the world of computing.

        Today, I stand as a web developer with a scientist's curiosity and an
        inventor's zeal, constantly intrigued by the underlying mechanics of the
        digital world. I take pleasure in crafting automation tools for even the
        simplest tasks, always chasing the joy of creating efficient, precise,
        and elegant solutions.
